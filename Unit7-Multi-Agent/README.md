# Unit 7: Multi Agent

## Training

Training takes several hours. Better to run it inside tmux.

To train run this from the Unit7-Multi-Agent directory:
`mlagents-learn ./configs/SoccerTwos.yaml --env=../ml-agents/training-envs-executables/SoccerTwos/SoccerTwos.x86_64 --run-id="SoccerTwos" --no-graphics`
